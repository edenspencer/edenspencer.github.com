Welcome to my blog. Now with added Jeykll!

This blog will be about my journey towards software craftsmanship.

I have been accepted as Enrique Comba Reipenhausen's apprentice. I will blog here about the successes and failures of my tasks along the way.

I am a designer with no computer science background, so I expect my journey to be longer and bumpier than most.

More will follow about the Wiki Task I have been set and my slow progress/ lessons learned.
